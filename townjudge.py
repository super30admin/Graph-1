    Description: find a town judge from relations between N people
    
    Time Complexity: O(V + E), V -> Vertices and E -> Edges (Graph)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    
    Approach: Use of nd-array, 2 pass
    - create an array of size N
    - Use the indices + 1 to update the array (first pass)
      + add 1 for every index when judge - 1 is the person someone trust
      + reduce 1 for every index for each person
    - find if any value in nd-array matches with N - 1
      + if yes: return index + 1
      + if no: return -1
