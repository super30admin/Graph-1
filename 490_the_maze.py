"""
Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/

Approach: DFS using stack
To explore the search space by rolling the ball into all stopping positions, while also keeping track of already visited positions so that we do not repeat our paths.

Time complexity : O(mn). Complete traversal of maze will be done in the worst case. Here, m and n refers to the number of rows and columns of the maze.
Space complexity : O(mn). visited array of size mâˆ—n is used.
